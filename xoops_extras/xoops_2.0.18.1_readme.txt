Instructions for adding linkexternal.js to XOOPS 2.0.18.1.

1. copy the contents of the XOOPS_extras folder to your root xoops folder overwriting existing.

2. clean templates_c & cache folders except for index.html.


For those that want to add linkexternal.js manually without overwriting header.php

1. copy the linkexternal.js in the XOOPS_extras/include folder to your xoops_root/include folder.

2. Edit your exisiting xoops header.php file as follows >

open header.php

find on line 68:

$xoTheme->addScript( '/include/xoops.js', array( 'type' => 'text/javascript' ) );

add right after:

$xoTheme->addScript('/include/linkexternal.js', array('type' => 'text/javascript')); // added by vaughan for rel="external" & rel="nofollow" etc. (it's better for resources & speed to use a seperate file rather than keep adding to xoops.js


save & close.

3. clean templates_c & cache folders except for index.html.

All Done.

now wfdownloads should work correctly on xoops 2.0.18.1, and you will also be able to use rel="external", rel="nofollow" & rel="external nofollow" throughout your XOOPS.
